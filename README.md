Power BI Sales Performance Analysis of Olist E-Commerce Platform in Brazil

ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This analysis uncovers key sales patterns across product categories, states, and cities in Brazil. Using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for visualization, it identifies top-performing products, revenue-driving regions, and areas with untapped potential â€” enabling clear, data-backed recommendations.

ðŸ“Œ Project Aim

To analyze sales performance and regional distribution using Power BI and SQL in order to:

â€¢	Identify top and underperforming product categories

â€¢	Examine sales variation across Brazilian states and cities

â€¢	Deliver actionable insights to support business decisions

ðŸ“Œ Data Source and Scope

Source: Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Kaggle) [download dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

Description: Includes sales, order, product, customer, seller, location, and transaction data

Scope of Analysis:

32,950+ product category sales records

72 unique product categories

Coverage across 27 Brazilian states and 3,000+ cities

ðŸ“Œ Methodology

SQL (Data Exploration)

â€¢	Explored all 9 interrelated tables using the ERD

â€¢	Validated key relationships (e.g., order ID, seller ID, product ID)

â€¢	Aggregated sales by state, city, and product category

â€¢	Used ROW_NUMBER() to rank top-selling products by state

Power BI (Modeling & Visualization)

â€¢	Cleaned and shaped data using Power Query

â€¢	Defined relationships and created a star schema

â€¢	Built interactive visuals: decomposition trees, bar charts, KPI cards

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

Sales Are Highly Concentrated: SÃ£o Paulo (SP) alone contributes 60%+ of total sales, led by cities like SÃ£o Paulo, Guarulhos, and Ibitinga.

Top Categories Are Lifestyle-Focused: Health & Beauty, Watches, and Home Decor dominate, reflecting strong, recurring demand.

Some Categories Are Obsolete or Niche: CDs/DVDs and Security Services show consistently low sales across regions.

North/Northeast States Lag in Sales: States like AM and AC have lower sales due to limited seller presence and logistical barriers.

Seller Presence Drives Revenue: States with more seller cities generate higher revenue â€” reinforcing the importance of local seller density.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how category performance and regional presence shape Brazilâ€™s e-commerce landscape. SQL and Power BI insights reveal dominant regions and categories, offering a roadmap for more balanced, data-driven growth.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

Scale Top Performers: Focus on high-performing categories like beauty, health, and home through improved logistics and promotion.

Audit Low Performers: Assess whether poor sales stem from outdated products, low visibility, or weak regional fit.

Expand Regional Reach: Boost seller onboarding and marketing in low-coverage states like AM and AC.

Customize by Region: Align product and marketing strategies with local cultural and economic contexts.

Track Consumer Trends: Continuously monitor buyer behaviour to adapt product offerings accordingly.
